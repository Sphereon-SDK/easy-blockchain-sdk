## Introduction

Welcome to the easy blockchain SDK. This SDK allows you to integrate blockchain technology into your own product, without having to worry about the low level details of blockchain or cryptocurrencies.
Several use cases exist for this blockchain SDK. The simplest being a Proof of Existence: Prove that a certain object existed somewhere in time and prove that the same object hasn't been changed since. Of course more advanced implementations are possible like Proof of Processing for instance.
